<p> I am currently a senior in High School and for my 
final Software Engineering project it is a Independent study session, 
I will be looking into A-frame

</p>

### <strong>Deciding on a Potiental Topic</strong>

<p>So after days of Googling, searching through the links that Mr.Mueller provided to us, 
 looking at a endless list of things I had no idea they were, I came across A-frame. It took me a while to even come across something I was partly interested in because I knew nothing about any of 
 the topics. I got lost in a world of internet..... and it got confusing not gonna lie. I would take breaks because at certain points I got distracted because there was so much and I didn't know what I was looking for.
 It caught my attention because of the demos. It caught my attention that it links to virtual reality 
 and Ive used the Vr before and seen first hand the things its capable of. Im still trying t get a feel for what 
 I could do with A-frame and the setup of it, but this is one topic that I think im going to do.

### <strong>What is A-Frame?</strong>

<p>When looking up A-frame I came across this :
A-Frame can be developed from a plain HTML file without having to install anything.
A great way to try out A-Frame is to remix the starter example on Glitch, an online code editor that instantly hosts and deploys for free. 
Alternatively, create an .html file and include A-Frame in the <head>:
```
   <html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.9.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>

```

 


### <strong>Takeaways</strong>
<ul>
    <li>When going into Independent Studies, be okay with not having a plan for the first few days and just get lost</li>
    <li> Don't just rely on one website for your information , not everything is on one site, google is your friend</li>
    <li>Patience is key</li>
    <li> Jot down all the links you want to refer back to </li>
</ul>
