<h1><center> A-Frame is the Way to Go!!! </center></h1>

<h2><center> Week Two of Nine Weeks </center></h2>

<p><center>(Did you ask how did my week go day by day? Well let me tell you....)</p>

<h4> Monday 
</h4>
<p>GOAL for this week: In the start of this week my goal was to pick a topic for Independent Study by Wednesday.By Friday I wanted to have an idea of what kind of project I'm going to create....
<br>As you can tell by the title.....(insert gif) <br>


A-Frame is my Independent Study Topic!</p>


<h4>Tuesday </h4>

<p>Before I get into my learning, I wrote down some tips since its Tip Tuesday that I resonated with are:</p>

<li>Xavier - google is your friend/choose something that interests you </li>
<br>
<li>Arieta - connect what you are learning to what you know / make your own versions of what you find in tutorials </li>
<br>
<li>Wei- chart your findings/ take notes </li>
<br>
<li>Raquel - start small /  the “Hello World” idea </li>

<h4>Wednesday-Thursday</h4>
<p>These two days were informatioN days. After figuring out that I wanted to do A-frame I wanted to start to learn A-frame. At first I wanted to think about what I wanted to make and then learn and that works for some people but after a day of not reallig getting an idea I realized that that process doesn't work for me. I decided that I am going to first learn and then decide based on how much I know decide what project I will make. </p>
<p>As I was going through the tutorials I was keeping track on the information I found</p>
<p>Installation
Running python -m SimpleHTTPServer (or python -m http.server for Python 3) in a terminal in the same directory as your HTML file.
Running npm install -g live-server && live-server in a terminal in the same directory as your HTML file.
Once we are running our server, we can open our project in the browser using the local URL and port which the server is running on (e.g., http://localhost:8000). Try notto open the project using the file:// protocol which does not provide a domain; absolute and relative URLs may not work.

https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate/

include the JS Build
To include A-Frame in an HTML file, we drop a <script> tag pointing to the CDN build:

<head>
 <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.9.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
</head>
nstall from npm
We can also install A-Frame through npm:
$ npm install aframe
Then we can bundle A-Frame into our application. For example, with Browserify or Webpack:
require('aframe');
If you use npm, you can use angle, a command line interface for A-Frame. angle can initialize a scene template with a single command:
npm install -g angle && angle initscene
Html & Primitives

A-Frame provides a handful of elements such as <a-box> or <a-sky> calledprimitives that wrap the entity-component pattern to make it appealing for beginners. 

Primitives act as a convenience layer (i.e., syntactic sugar) primarily for newcomers. Keep in mind for now that primitives are <a-entity>s under the hood that:

Have a semantic name (e.g., <a-box>)
Have a preset bundle of components with default values
Map or proxy HTML attributes to component data

Under the hood, this <a-box> primitive:

<a-box color="red" width="3"></a-box>
represents this entity-component form:
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 3" material="color: red"></a-entity>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<li>Notes are a good strategy to use when first learning a topic</li>
<li>Decide what process best for you when having to learn something and create something from what you learn</li>
