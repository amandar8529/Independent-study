<h1><center>The world of A-Frame is Megaaa,Tinkering is the solution!</center></h1>
<h2><center>Week Three of Nine Weeks</center></h2>
<h4>Monday:</h4>
<p>Goal for this week: In the start of this week my goal was to dive right into A-frame and start completely the tutorials and start learning the basics. </p>



<h4> Wednesday: </h4>

<p>To do a bulk of my learning I've been using three really insightful websites. </p>

<p> I started Wednesday with looking into ECS. A-Frame is a three.js framework with an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture. Its a pattern used in game programming. I started with breaking each of these components and understand how they work seperately before understanding how they work together.

<h4> Entity</h4>
<li>A placeholder objects where you plug in components so they could have physical traits (appearances), behavior (what they do), functionality (how they function/their process)
<li>Using attached to position,rotation,scale
<li>Entities have an id name 
<li>To call an entity you do (‘#the_name’)

Examples:

```<a-entity> ``` :This is an empty entity (basically it does nothing ) <br>
```<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red">``` : this is giving it a shape ("box") and an appearance ("color: red") <br>

```<a-entity id="box"></a-entity>  ```
``` var el = document.querySelector('#box'); ``` : This is how you call the entity
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<li>Learning is doing</li>
